## HOW IT WORKS
When you open the Dad Joke Generator, you'll see a simple and user-friendly interface. The heart of this application lies in the JavaScript code, which interacts with the Dad Joke API to fetch a new joke every time the "Tell me a joke" button is clicked.

The HTML and CSS provide the structure and style to create an engaging and visually appealing experience for users. The "Tell me a joke" button triggers a JavaScript function that sends a request to the Dad Joke API and receives a random dad joke in response. The joke is then dynamically displayed on the page, bringing an instant smile to your face.

## Features
Random Dad Jokes: Click the "Tell me a joke" button to instantly receive a new and hilarious dad joke. No two jokes are the same, ensuring endless laughter.

Sleek and Responsive Design: The Dad Joke Generator is designed with a clean and modern layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Enjoy the same great experience on your computer, tablet, or smartphone.

Share the Laughter: Have a favorite dad joke that you can't help but share with others? Easily copy the joke from the page and spread the laughter with your friends and family.
